# A responsive website built on Flutter web

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application for me. I am learning Flutter layout concepts while building this.


There is a blog post on this on https://rizwaniqbal.com/posts/flutter-web-experiment/


## Resources I referred to while building this

* This section of flutter documentation really explains in detail how a Non-material layout could be constructed from scratch - [Flutter Layout Basics](https://flutter.dev/docs/codelabs/layout-basics)
- [Bulding layouts in Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout)
- [Building Layouts tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/tutorial)

* For LayoutBuilder and responsive apps
- [Creating responsive apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/responsive)
- [Layout Builder Class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html)
- [Flutter LaoutBuilder Widget blog post](https://medium.com/@KarthikPonnam/flutter-layoutbuilder-widget-1-b09fd1e6907f)
- [This guys website that demo's responsive web design on flutter web](https://github.com/iampawan/MyPortfolio)

* Navigation basics
- [Flutter Cookbook for Navigation](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation)

Apart from these, these links that come as part of the standard new app are also useful -

* [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
* [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
